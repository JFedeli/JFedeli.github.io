  <h2 class="title">Cloud Service Models</h2>
  <p class="text"> Cloud computing can be sorted into two main categories which are deployment models and service models. Examples of deployment models would be: public cloud, private cloud, hybrid cloud, and multicloud. Service models consist of infrastructure as a service (IaaS), Platform as a service (PaaS), Software as a service (SaaS), as well as serverless computing. These models just describe how a cloud is structured as well as who has access to it </p>
